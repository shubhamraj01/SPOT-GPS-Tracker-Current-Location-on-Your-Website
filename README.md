# Interesting features
--------
spotparse.py does the following:
 * saves current latitude,longitude to a file
 * saves all known locations returned from the SPOT API as JSON
 * optionally, keeps adding to the file, saving your tracks for an entire trip (until you move the JSON file)
 * generates a map with all coordinates in the JSON cache file plotted, and a line drawn between them (requires pygmaps python module)
 * same as above, but as XML as well
 * lets you know if your batteries need to be changed.

```
Usage: spotparse.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           print debug messages
  -k, --keep-json-tracks
                        keep all tracks until file is moved
  -m, --map             generates a google map with all points (and draws line between them)
  --map-zoom=MAP_ZOOM   zoom level for map
```

# basic usage
-----------
Edit the file, to add your spot_id and file paths, then:

Just run `spotparse.py -k -m >/dev/null` from cron (every 15 minutes at most), and it will generate a map.

# background
----------
If you subscribe to the Track Progress service with SPOT, you can tell the GPS device to send your location to SPOT via satellite every minutes, and then export those tracks at a later time.

They even have an API from which you can fetch JSON with all your current tracks! The unfortunate part, and the reason for this script, is that they only keep 30 days of GPS coordinates.

It’s not a problem if you export your data to Spot Adventures and create an “adventure” — that will live forever. But if you wish to present “my current location” on your personal web page, for example, you’re out of luck. It will only work as long as you’ve used the track progress functionality within the last 30 days.

I guess you need to cache the last used location yourself.

# spotparse.py
------------
New hotness. Works very well and clearence.

Run this from cron every 15 minutes, and you’ll always have your last checked-in  location when you land with GPS coordinates!

And a .json (and .xml) file that matches what SPOT has for you - overwritten on each run, unless -k is used.
